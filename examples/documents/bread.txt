## The Art of Sourdough Bread Making

Sourdough bread, with its distinctive tangy flavor and chewy texture, has experienced a resurgence in popularity. Unlike regular bread, sourdough does not rely on commercial yeast for fermentation. Instead, it uses a 'starter' â€“ a fermented mixture of flour and water that contains wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria. The fermentation process, which can take several hours to days, not only contributes to the bread's unique flavor but also breaks down gluten, making it easier to digest. Sourdough bread making is considered an art, requiring skill and patience, as each starter develops its own unique characteristics over time, 
influenced by its specific environment. Also, it's delicious.
